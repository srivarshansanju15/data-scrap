0,Can't complain or moan at all!!,"  I paid £59.99 for this tablet so really for that price I can't see how anyone can give less than 5 stars or a negative review! Buy any other tablet for that price that can compare to this I challenge you..why oh why some people are moaning about it is beyond me, it states quite clearly in the write up what it is /does/specs etc and really if you want 'better' then spend more money and stop thinking you are going to get 'the elite' of all tablets for this sort of money! Brilliant tablet and definitely worth twice the money Amazon are asking. Great sound, screen, performance, love the colour and ease of use. Thank you Amazon.. I for one would certainly not insult your intelligence by saying anything negative about this tablet..but then I don't enjoy drama and moaning.P.S...I also own an ipad 2017, an ipad mini 4, a Samsung tab s4, a lenovo yoga Pro, lenovo tab 4 and a Huawei media pad m5 ..and this fire tablet compete's well!

1,Perfect for my e-books and all,"  This was a gift and I couldn't be happier. I was asked what kind of tablet I wanted so I looked around the shops before settling on this one. I originally wanted a kindle for reading e-books, but having browsed a few, I found the kindles just a little too small and dreary. I found the iPads (among others) too large and overkill for simply reading e-books. So I settled on the Amazon Fire HD 8 because it was the perfect size (slightly bigger than the Kindles I'd tried) and downloading e-books through the Amazon kindle store was easy. I also read a lot at night before bed, and this tablet has a 'Blue Shade' function - which reduces the amount of blue light (blue light at night apparently makes it harder to fall asleep) emitted from the screen.I had only intended to use the Fire for reading - but inevitably ended up downloading apps and audiobooks. I now use it pretty much like an iPad. I have Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, iPlayer, Alexa, BBC news etc. all on the tablet now.For the price - this is a great tablet. So far, I'm impressed. I won't give it 5 stars however, as I do have a couple of small gripes. One is that the tablet can be a little laggy and slow (not always but sometimes) which I assume is due to the device not being able to cope with too many apps/too much demand upon its memory. This is only a small gripe as the lag is brief and not all that noticeable. The second issue I have is that when you purchase this online, you are given the option to purchase the tablet with or without 'special offers' - this would imply some additional benefit surely? But no - 'special offers' actually means - 'with advertising', which annoyingly pop up on your screen. It is slightly more money to buy the device 'without special offers' so it depends whether you mind seeing ads or not, if you're unsure of which option to choose. Don't despair if you've chosen the option with ads - you can still pay to have these removed after purchase. They should rephrase this at the point of sale though, as it isn't clear. (see photo which highlights the kind of advertisements that appear on my tablet).But overall - I definitely recommend this tablet. It's such a nifty little thing, great value for money, and I love it. And definitely BUY A CASE! You'll need it.If you found this review helpful - please let me know. Thanks

2,Could have been a contender!,"  Firstly I have to say that what the Fire 8 does, it does very well.I'm familiar with Android tablets and phones and originally thought that that is what this is. Well it kind of is but not really.There are some apps which I use on my phone like KASA and SMART LIFE which enable me to set up and control the 'smart plugs' in my home. Amazon (who sold me the plugs) don't have the apps and Google play won't let me download the apps onto an Amazon Fire so I'm a bit stuffed in the smart direction. I can control with my phone but if I didn't have the phone in the first place I could not have set them up to work with Alexa. I spent a good hour on the phone to Amazon but their 'representative' just could not grasp what I was going on about and what I needed to do.What also I didn't understand was that when you buy the Fire it has ""with special offers"" in its description. I thought that meant there would be freebies or stuff pertaining to the machine. Be warned thats not what it means, it means that there is a constant barrage of adverts coming through whenever it feels like it. You are supposed to pay £10 to switch off 'the special offers' which I think is a bit naff. I subsequently noticed an option on the purchase page of the site which enables you to choose with or without offers. You'd have to click on without to find its £10 more but why would you not want to have it with special offers? Its a bit naughty and misleading.That said its great having Alexa built in and working on the battery. I have a few echos because I want to use them in different places in the house. You can't really unplug in one room and then plug in in another (well you can but its a faff to wait until it logs back in etc) but now with Alexa on the fire you can take it anywhere, loft, garden, garage etc so thats a very big plus.Final conclusion is, as I wrote initially, it does what it does well but there are things I'm sure it could do but Amazon, for its own reasons won't let it.Its a big shame really but I suppose you could say ""you get what you pay for."" and its still not bad value.I looked to buy a protective case but found the pricing prohibitive. It costs almost as much for a plastic case as it does for a Fire7 with all its technology and uses. Seems Amazon is sucessfully doing a 'Ryan Air' in selling the basics cheap and then charging lots for ancilliarys.Camera is only OK, its not great. Screen is alright although it doesn't have the punchy colours and sharpness I would expect from a piece of kit with HD in its title. My ancient Nexus 7 was much better but it died on me and that's why I bought this.I still like it and find it useful but it could have been so much better. You'll have to decide whether its worth paying six times as much for an iPad.
